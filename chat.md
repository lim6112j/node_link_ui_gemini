# Node-Link UI Web App Development Summary

This document summarizes the development process of a node-link UI web application, similar to ComfyUI.

## 1. Project Setup and Initialization

- **Objective:** Create a node-link UI web application.
- **Technology Stack:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Flow.
- **Initialization:** The project was initialized using Vite with a React and TypeScript template.
- **Dependencies:** Installed `reactflow`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`.

## 2. Configuration and Troubleshooting

- **Tailwind CSS Setup:** Encountered issues initializing Tailwind CSS via `npx`. The `tailwindcss` executable was not found in `node_modules/.bin`.
- **Resolution:**
    1. Reinstalled dependencies after removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
    2. Manually created `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
    3. Encountered a PostCSS plugin issue, which was resolved by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating `postcss.config.js`.

## 3. Core UI Implementation

- **Canvas:** A basic React Flow canvas was set up in `App.tsx`.
- **Sidebar:** A sidebar component (`Sidebar.tsx`) was created to hold draggable node types.
- **Drag and Drop:** Implemented functionality to drag nodes from the sidebar and drop them onto the canvas to create new nodes.
- **Properties Panel:**
    - Created a `PropertiesPanel.tsx` component to edit the properties of a selected node.
    - Initially, the panel did not update when a new node was selected.
    - **Bug Fix:** Used the `useEffect` hook in `PropertiesPanel.tsx` to listen for changes to the `selectedNode` prop and update the panel's state accordingly.

## 4. Node Type Enhancements

- **Custom Nodes:** The user requested more specific node types with defined input/output handles.
- **Implementation:**
    1.  **`StartNode.tsx`:** Created a node with only a source (output) handle.
    2.  **`EndNode.tsx`:** Created a node with only a target (input) handle.
    3.  **`CustomNode.tsx`:** Created a default node with both target (input) and source (output) handles.
- **UI Updates:**
    - The `Sidebar.tsx` was updated to include the new "Start", "End", and "Custom" nodes.
    - The main `App.tsx` was updated to register and use these new node components.
